//! Watch surface — Phase 3, ROADMAP.md:862.
//!
//! [`WatchableStore`] wraps an [`MvccStore`] and dispatches every applied
//! write to registered watchers whose range covers the event key **and**
//! whose `start_rev` permits the event. Watchers receive events in commit
//! order via a [`WatchStream`] (a `futures_core::Stream` of
//! `Result<WatchEvent, WatchError>`).
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! - [`WatchEvent`] / [`WatchEventKind`] — pure data, no I/O, no
//!   locks. Cloned per-watcher in the dispatch path.
//! - [`WriteObserver`] — the trait the writer hot path
//!   ([`crate::store::MvccStore::put`] / `delete_range` / `txn`)
//!   calls under its writer mutex AFTER `snapshot.store()`. The slot
//!   on `MvccStore` is one `arc_swap::ArcSwap<Option<Arc<dyn WriteObserver>>>`
//!   field (see [`crate::store::MvccStore::attach_observer`]).
//! - [`WatchableStore`] — the registry + the `WriteObserver` impl.
//!   Single-tenant per `MvccStore` (the observer slot is single-occupancy).
//! - [`WatchStream`] — the per-watcher stream returned by `watch()`.
//!
//! # Etcd parity
//!
//! `WatchEventKind` discriminants match
//! `etcdserver/api/mvcc/mvccpb.Event_EventType` (`PUT = 0`,
//! `DELETE = 1`) at tag `v3.5.16`. Pinned by the
//! `watch_event_kind_discriminants_match_etcd` test below.
//!
//! Wire-format byte equality lives at Phase 7 (gRPC service). This
//! module is the in-memory shape only.
//!
//! # Race-free `start_rev` resolution
//!
//! `watch()` reads `current_revision()` **inside** the registry write-lock,
//! which is mutex-exclusive with the dispatch path's registry read-lock.
//! Plus the writer mutex serializes `snapshot.store()` with dispatch's
//! registry-read acquisition. Together the two locks pin the
//! "registration vs dispatch" interleaving: every event with `revision >=
//! resolved_start` is delivered exactly once, and no event with
//! `revision < resolved_start` is delivered. See Phase 3 plan §4.4 for
//! the full proof.
